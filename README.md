## Installation & usage
Check out the latest release at: <https://github.com/edk2-porting/edk2-rk35xx/releases>, including install instructions.

## Configuration settings
The UEFI configuration settings can be viewed and changed using both the UI configuration menu (under `Device Manager` -> `Rockchip Platform Configuration`), as well as the UEFI Shell. To configure using the UEFI Shell, use `setvar` command to read/write the UEFI variables with GUID = `10f41c33-a468-42cd-85ee-7043213f73a3`.

The syntax to read a setting is:
```
setvar <NAME> -guid 10f41c33-a468-42cd-85ee-7043213f73a3
```

The syntax to write a setting is:
```
setvar <NAME> -guid 10f41c33-a468-42cd-85ee-7043213f73a3 -bs -rt -nv =<VALUE>
```
`VALUE` must be in hexadecimal.

For string-type settings, the syntax to write is:
```
setvar <NAME> -guid 10f41c33-a468-42cd-85ee-7043213f73a3 -bs -rt -nv =L"<VALUE>" =0x0000
```

### CPU Performance
#### Cluster clocks / voltages
| Variable                          |    NAME                            |  VALUE                       |
| --------------------------------- |----------------------------------- |----------------------------- |
| CPU`x` Clock Preset               | `CpuPerf_CPUxClusterClockPreset`   | Boot default = `0x00000000`<br> Min = `0x00000001`<br> Max = `0x00000002`<br> Custom = `0x00000003` |
| CPU`x` Custom Clock Preset (MHz)  | `CpuPerf_CPUxClusterClockCustom`   | Hex numeric option, 4-bytes<br> See below. |
| CPU`x` Voltage Mode               | `CpuPerf_CPUxClusterVoltageMode`   | Auto = `0x00000000` (default)<br> Custom = `0x00000001`|
| CPU`x` Custom Voltage (uV)        | `CpuPerf_CPUxClusterVoltageCustom` | Hex numeric value, 4-bytes<br> See below. |

`x` can be :
* `L` for LITTLE cluster
* `B01` for big cluster #0
* `B23` for big cluster #1

`CpuPerf_CPUxClusterClockCustom` can have one of the following values:
* All clusters: `408000000`, `600000000`, `816000000`, `1008000000`, `1200000000`, `1416000000`, `1608000000`, `1800000000`
* Big cluster additional clocks: `2016000000`, `2208000000`, `2256000000`, `2304000000`, `2352000000`, `2400000000`

`CpuPerf_CPUxClusterVoltageCustom` is the cluster voltage in microvolts. Min: `500000`, Max: `1500000`. 
Default value depends on cluster type.

### PCIe/SATA/USB Combo PIPE PHY
| Variable    |    NAME         |  VALUE                       |
| ----------- |-----------------|----------------------------------- |
| PHY #0 Mode | `ComboPhy0Mode` | Unconnected = `0x00000000`<br> PCIe = `0x00000001`<br> SATA = `0x00000002` |
| PHY #1 Mode | `ComboPhy1Mode` | Unconnected = `0x00000000`<br> PCIe = `0x00000001`<br> SATA = `0x00000002` |
| PHY #2 Mode | `ComboPhy2Mode` | Unconnected = `0x00000000`<br> PCIe = `0x00000001`<br> SATA = `0x00000002`<br> USB3 = `0x00000003` |

Default values and supported options depend on the platform. Check documentation and schematics for more details on PHY wiring.

**Examples:**
- To read the 'CPUL Clock Preset' setting :
```
setvar CpuPerf_CPULClusterClockPreset -guid 10f41c33-a468-42cd-85ee-7043213f73a3
```

- To change the 'CPUL Clock Preset' setting to 'Maximum' :
```
setvar CpuPerf_CPULClusterClockPreset -guid 10f41c33-a468-42cd-85ee-7043213f73a3 -bs -rt -nv =0x00000002
```

## Building
The firmware can only be built on Linux currently. For Windows use WSL.

1. Install required packages:

   For Ubuntu/Debian:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install git gcc g++ build-essential gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu iasl python3-pyelftools device-tree-compiler
   ```
   For Arch Linux:
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -Syu
   sudo pacman -S git base-devel gcc dtc aarch64-linux-gnu-binutils aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc aarch64-linux-gnu-glibc python python-pyelftools iasl --needed
   ```

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/edk2-porting/edk2-rk35xx.git --recursive
   cd edk2-rk35xx
   ```

3. Build UEFI (ROCK 5B for example, check [list of platform configs](https://github.com/edk2-porting/edk2-rk35xx/tree/master/configs)):
   ```bash
   ./build.sh --device rock-5b --release Release # (or Debug)
   ```

## Notes
### ACPI
ACPI support is limited, with only boot critical devices being currently exposed. It has been tested with Windows, NetBSD and VMware ESXi.

## Licenses
The UEFI code and produced FD binary are licensed under the current EDK2 license, which is [BSD-2-Clause-Patent](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/License.txt).

The license of the blobs in the `misc/rkbin/` directory is to be determined. Most of them are built from open-source projects such as U-Boot, Arm Trusted Firmware and OP-TEE.

## Credits & alternatives
This firmware is based on Rockchip's initial efforts at <https://gitlab.com/rk3588_linux/rk/uefi-monorepo>.

There's also minimal support for RK356X (likely broken in our repo with no plans of reviving), but there's a much better implementation made by @jaredmcneill at https://github.com/jaredmcneill/quartz64_uefi, from which we also reused some code.
